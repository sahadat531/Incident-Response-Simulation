## Project Overview

The **Incident Response Simulation** monitors a designated folder for file events like creation, modification, or deletion. It logs these activities and provides an analysis script to generate an incident report. The project is designed for educational purposes and to showcase incident response principles.

---

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks file creation and modification in a target folder.
- **Incident Logging**: Captures and stores details of suspicious activities in a log file.
- **Analysis and Reporting**: Processes logs to generate a structured incident report.
- **Customizable**: Can be extended to include more sophisticated detection mechanisms.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/incident_response_simulation.git
   cd incident_response_simulation
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create Monitoring Folder**:
   Create a folder named `monitor_folder` in the project directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir monitor_folder
   ```

---

## Usage

### **1. Monitor File Events**:
Run the `file_monitor.py` script to start monitoring the `monitor_folder`:
```bash
python file_monitor.py
```
Perform actions like creating or modifying files in the `monitor_folder` to simulate incidents.

### **2. Analyze Logs**:
After stopping the monitoring script, analyze the logs:
```bash
python analyze_logs.py
```
This will generate a report of detected incidents.
